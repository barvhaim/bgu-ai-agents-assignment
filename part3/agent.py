Part 3 — Wire Your Loop to a LIVE MCP Exchange
===============================================
Same loop as Part 2 — and the same two kinds of tools, side by side:

    Part 2:  tools = TOOL_FN dict          (Python functions in your file)
    Part 3:  tools = ONE MCP server  +  a local TOOL_FN helper

The MCP server is the real competition exchange at agent-stocks.vercel.app.
Prices are live US-market prices, the leaderboard is shared with every other
team, and orders move real (pretend) money. Nothing is deterministic anymore —
so your agent must read what actually happened and never fake a result.

Alongside the exchange your agent also gets one *local* Python tool —
`pct_change`, a pure compute helper (no network) that reports the percent move
between two prices. It's the same dict-of-functions you wrote in Part 2; it
just lives next to the MCP tools in one flat list the model sees. You may ADD
more local tools (function + TOOL_FN + LOCAL_TOOLS entry).

Three roles, same as always:
    Ollama (granite4:micro) = the BRAIN   (model provider, text in / text out)
    MCP exchange + local    = the HANDS   (tools the agent can call)
    THIS FILE               = the LOOP    (run_agent — the code YOU write)

You implement the same building blocks you would for any MCP agent — the same
shape as Part 2, plus the MCP twist:
    TODO 1. mcp_tools_to_openai(mcp_tools)  — translate the server's tool list
            into the OpenAI-compatible chat-completions tool schema (same shape
            you wrote by hand in Part 2's TOOLS list). Ollama, OpenAI, vLLM,
            LiteLLM, etc. all accept this same shape.
    TODO 2. dispatch_tool(name, args, ...)  — like Part 2's dispatch_tool, but a
            tool is now EITHER a local Python function (TOOL_FN) OR a remote MCP
            tool (await client.call_tool). Route each to the right place.
    TODO 3. run_agent(goal, client)         — the observe -> think -> act loop.
            It merges BOTH kinds of tools into one list and calls dispatch_tool
            on each requested tool call.

Everything else — the trading system prompt, the local helper, the goals, the
goal-driving driver `run_goals`, the trace writer, .env loading — is provided.
The driver runs each instructor-set GOAL once; for every goal the *model*
decides what to do, and you submit the trace it produced.

Before you write code, do Part 3A: explore the exchange by hand with the MCP
Inspector and fill in part3/inspector_worksheet.md. See part3/README.md.

Setup (Part 3B):
    1. Register your team ON THE WEBSITE (https://agent-stocks.vercel.app) to
       get your API key. Do NOT register from code.
    2. Put the key in part3/.env (already in .gitignore):
           AGENTS_EXCHANGE_API_KEY=ax_your_key_here
    3. Run:
           uv run python part3/agent.py            # run every goal
           uv run python part3/agent.py --only 3   # re-run just goal 3

SYSTEM_PROMPT = """\
You are an autonomous trading agent on a live stock exchange. You are given one \
goal at a time. Inspect the market and your portfolio with the provided tools \
as needed, then act on the goal, placing AT MOST ONE order.

Tools return cents-based fields (last_cents, cash_cents). Quantities are whole \
shares. Every trade pays a 0.05% fee, so a buy of qty shares costs about \
price_cents * qty * 1.0005 — leave headroom for it.

MONEY IS IN CENTS. To show dollars, divide the cents value by 100 and format \
with two decimals — NEVER print a cents number with a dollar sign. \
For example: cash_cents 10000000 = $100,000.00; last_cents 57722 = $577.22; \
last_cents 18500 = $185.00. When a goal asks for dollars, always do this \
conversion before you answer.

Safety rules you MUST follow:
- Never overdraw: a buy can't cost more cash than you have (fee included).
- Only sell shares you actually hold; the exchange rejects short selling.
- If place_order returns an {"error": ...}, READ it and adapt. Never claim a \
trade succeeded when it did not.

When you have satisfied the goal, reply with a short plain-text summary of what \
you did and why, and make no further tool call."""

    client. main()/run_goals() owns the session lifecycle — run_agent never opens
